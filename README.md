## Overview

MeshUtility is a tray-resident desktop app combining two powerful tools:

**Voice Dictation** — Hold your hotkey, speak, release. Your words are transcribed and injected into any text field, in any app. Supports local offline Whisper models and cloud Groq Whisper API.

**Prompt Enhancer** — Select text anywhere, hit your shortcut, and an AI rewrites it. Supports Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral, and any OpenAI-compatible API. Results stream directly in a floating overlay.

## Features

### Voice Dictation
- Push-to-talk or toggle recording mode with a configurable global hotkey (`Alt+Space` default)
- Local offline transcription via whisper.cpp and sherpa-onnx parakeet model
- Cloud transcription via the Groq Whisper API (requires API key)
- Custom pronunciation dictionary for domain-specific terms and names
- Full transcription history with word count, duration, and timestamp
- Microphone selection, sensitivity control, and device status checks
- Partial transcription preview while recording (Hinglish / multilingual)

### Prompt Enhancer
- Streaming AI output with support for Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- Built-in prompt action library: Enhance, Make Concise, Fix Grammar, Translate, Summarize, and more
- Floating overlay window that activates on a global shortcut and captures selected text
- One-click copy or replace the selected text with the enhanced output
- Prompt action history with full input/output log
- Per-provider model selection, temperature, and token limit settings

### System
- Lives in the system tray — minimal resource usage when idle
- Borderless custom window with native drag support
- Automatic launch at Windows startup
- Close to tray behavior keeps the app running in the background
- Floating pill widget with animated state transitions (idle, listening, processing, done)
- Auto-update check via GitHub Releases
- All history and settings stored in a local SQLite database — no cloud sync, no telemetry

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| Rust | 1.77 or later |
| Node.js | 20 or later |
| Tauri CLI | 2.x — install with `cargo install tauri-cli` |
| OS | Windows 10 or later (primary platform) |

macOS and Linux are partially supported. Some audio backend features may behave differently across platforms.

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jenesh11/MeshUtility.git
cd MeshUtility
```

### 2. Install Node dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run in development mode

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

### 4. Configure your API key

Once the app is running, open **Configuration > AI Providers** in the sidebar and enter your API key for the provider you want to use.

For cloud transcription, open **Configuration > Voice Settings** and enter your Groq API key. A free key is available at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com).

For local offline transcription, go to **Voice Settings**, select a Whisper model, and click Download. No API key is needed.

## Building for release

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

The installer and portable `.exe` are placed in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

|---|---|---|
| Hotkey | Global shortcut to start and stop voice recording | `Alt+Space` |
| Recording mode | `push-to-talk` holds to record, `toggle` clicks to start and stop | `push-to-talk` |
| Transcription engine | `local` uses whisper.cpp offline, `cloud` uses Groq Whisper API | `local` |
| Selected model | Whisper model file downloaded to local storage | none |
| Language mode | `auto`, `en`, `hi`, or any ISO language code | `auto` |
| Sensitivity | Microphone input gain multiplier 0 to 1 | `0.5` |
